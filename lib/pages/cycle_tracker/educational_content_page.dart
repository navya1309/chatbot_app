      content: """
A period (also called menstruation) is when the lining of the uterus sheds and exits the body through the vagina. It’s part of the menstrual cycle, your body’s natural way of preparing for a potential pregnancy each month.

Most people get their first period between ages 9–15, and it can take a few years to become regular.

Basic Breakdown:
- 🧠 Hormones signal the body to release an egg (ovulation).
- 🏡 The uterus builds a lining (endometrium) in case the egg gets fertilized.
- 💨 If there’s no pregnancy, the lining breaks down and flows out as a period.

What does it look like?
- Blood is usually dark red or brown.
- It can be light or heavy and may have small clots.
- Periods typically last 3–7 days.

Everyone’s cycle is different! But here’s a guide to help figure out what’s “normal” and when to check in with a doctor.

✅ Totally Normal:
- Cycle length: 21–35 days (counted from the first day of one period to the next).
- Flow that changes throughout the week.
- Mild cramps, mood swings, or tender breasts.
- Spotting between periods (sometimes during ovulation).

⚠️ Might Need Medical Attention If:
- Periods last longer than 8 days.
- Super painful cramps that stop you from doing daily things.
- Bleeding through pads/tampons every hour for several hours.
- You haven’t gotten your period by age 16.
- Periods suddenly stop for 3+ months (if not pregnant).
- You feel dizzy, weak, or constantly fatigued during periods.

      title: "PMS vs PMDD",
      content: """
PMS (Premenstrual Syndrome):
- Happens 1–2 weeks before your period.
- Caused by hormonal shifts (like estrogen and progesterone).
- Symptoms: mood swings, bloating, acne, cravings, headaches, irritability.
- Usually mild to moderate, and symptoms go away once your period starts.

PMDD (Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder):
- A more intense form of PMS.
- Affects mood very deeply — like depression, anxiety, or rage.
- Can interfere with school, sleep, relationships, and everyday life.
- PMDD is medical, not just “being moody.” If it feels extreme, talk to a doctor or therapist — there’s help.

      title: "Managing Cramps Naturally",
      content: """
Cramps = muscles of your uterus contracting to shed the lining. Annoying? Yes. Unmanageable? Not always.

Natural Relief Ideas:
- 🔥 Heat therapy: hot water bottle or heating pad on your belly = magic.
- 🧘‍♀️ Movement: light yoga, stretching, or even walking can reduce pain.
- 💧 Hydration: lots of water helps reduce bloating and inflammation.
- Anti-inflammatory foods: turmeric, ginger, leafy greens, berries.
- Herbal teas: chamomile, peppermint, raspberry leaf = calming.
- Magnesium + vitamin B6: can reduce cramps & moodiness.

If nothing works or cramps feel like sharp stabbing pain — talk to a doctor. You don’t need to suffer in silence.

Let’s get real and ditch the drama.

❌ Myth - ✅Truth

You can’t swim on your period. - You totally can! Just use a tampon or menstrual cup.

Period blood is dirty. - Nope. It’s just blood + tissue. Not gross. Just biology.

You can’t get pregnant on your period. - It’s rare, but still possible.

Periods sync with friends. - It feels like it, but there’s no proven science.

You shouldn’t exercise on your period. - Actually, it can reduce cramps and improve mood!

Hormones affect your body and your brain. You’re not imagining it.

Emotional Rollercoaster? You’re Not Alone.
- Estrogen and progesterone influence serotonin, which affects mood.
- PMS can make you feel anxious, sensitive, or down.
- You might feel foggy, unmotivated, or just not yourself.

Tips for Period-Time Mental Health:
- Track your mood (so you can spot patterns).
- Plan light days — don’t push yourself too hard.
- Sleep = essential. Aim for 8 hours.
- Talk about it. To friends, a journal, a therapist — whatever works.

If your period makes you feel hopeless, like nothing matters, or like you can’t cope — reach out for help. You’re not weak. You’re human.

Not everyone who gets periods is a girl. And not every girl gets periods.

If you're trans, non-binary, or gender diverse and you menstruate, you deserve period care that makes you feel safe, valid, and seen.

You’re Not Alone.
- Periods can feel dysphoric or triggering.
- Products are often marketed with super feminine vibes — which sucks.
- Using the bathroom during your period may feel uncomfortable or unsafe.

Tips That May Help:
- Use gender-neutral products (black box pads, discreet packaging).
- Call your period what feels right: cycle, shark week, code red — your body, your words.
- Track symptoms in a non-gendered app or journal.
- Wear what makes you feel comfortable: boxers, hoodies, layers.
- Consider reusable products like menstrual cups or discs (no strings, no sound).

Need support? Look for trans-affirming doctors or online spaces that respect your identity and your body.
